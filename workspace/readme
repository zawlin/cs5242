* Please ownload the trained models from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PLZsq5SV_lbbUdXLUrXo19iX9eibruoR?usp=sharing.
* NOTE:Latest version of spacy doesn't work. We run with spacy version 1.8.2. If you accidentally installed version 2.0, you may need to purge it from your system by
  manually deleting the python package folder instead of using pip since it seems to be bugged. You will also need to removed the models for version 2 and redownload version 1.8.2
* GPU ram of at least 12GB is required, to train 256 batch size models about 17gb is required.
* We used CUDA 8 with cudnn
* we provide the ensembling code separately in the root directory. It only requires final output csv. 
  For bi-att-flow, we forgot exactly which model was used and simply downloaded the kaggle csv to perform ensembling but it should be models around it ~20k.
